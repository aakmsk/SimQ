# About
SimQ is a simple quadrupedal robot created and maintained by aakmsk ([website](https://hirobot.tech)).

It can be used for reinforcement learning experiments using simulators such as PyBullet.

Currently, only URDF format files are available.
I am planning to add other file formats and functions in the future.
